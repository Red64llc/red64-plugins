# What is Red64

The objective is to build an open-source meta framework for Claude Code. 
The project is heavily influenced by excelent projects like "OS Agents" and "Super Claude".
The goal for the framework is to address the enterprise software development life cycle. 
What this framework is not: it is not for Vibe coding. 
It is for enterprise software development where robustness, performance, predictability, compliance, and security are critical to the success of a project. 

Functional goals for Red64:
- re-introduce a deterministic approach to SDLC (a la os-agent)
- introduce language and framework specific rule files (see ../standards/*)
- support team's specific coding style
- significantly improve team productivity by implementing tool (github, ticketing, pm) automations
- provide feedback through productivity metrics
- smart strategy to load MCP server
- augment a team's productivity and measure the ROI

Performance goals for Red64:
- supports Claude Code (plugins?)
- super easy to install (plugins?)
- optimize context size (using skill instead of rules, smart MCP strategy, etc...) 

What Red64 is not:
- not a replacement for Vide Coding products
